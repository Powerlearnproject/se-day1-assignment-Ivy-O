Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Its the application of emgineering principals to the design, development and maintanace of software. It is important because of the role it plays in intergating hardware with sustanable technological ideas in creating efficiency and eas of getting thing done

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
EALRY COMPUTING-This is when the first software was written in machine code for computers.
PEOGRAMING-This was when programing languages began to have stracure it also marked the introduction of IBM.
PERSONAL COMPUTERS- In the 80s the rise of personal computers became popular this was a big milestone with the addition of graphics and the internet

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
PLANNING- this is the brainstorming part where you come up with ideas and a step to step guide on how to achive this idea.
REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS- look at all the needs clearly define them 
DESIGN- In this stage you get to start choosing the direction you want to go when developing including which programing language you would like to use, all the specifics.
DEVELOPMENT-This is when we write the code based on the design choices we have made
TESTING- Trying out the code and fixing anything that is not working right or needs improvement.
DEPLOYMENt-This is when you get to publish the software so that users can interact with it.
MAINTANANCE- this is the part that ensures the software is conitnuous and sustanable including growth.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Water fall follows a step by step method like when developing a learnining platform while agile is flexible for example in gaming developments.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer excequtes the team vission they put the ideas into visible tangible results through the software they create.
QAE- Is incharge of making sure the developed software meets all the desired standards as set by the team and needs set.
PM- Oversees the whole operation from begininng to the end ensuring all parties play their part, to help in the creation process.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs-is like a one stop shop for software engineers it improves productivity, creates efficiency because of intergration like the Visueal studio code.
VCS-Helps to track changes eg GitHub.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Requirements keep being changed
debugging 
Security
the fast pace change in tech
Burnout

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit- testing individual compenents
Integration- Puts different components together
System-Thia tests the whole system to ensure it meets requirements
Acceptance- This is when the entire software is validated before release

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
This is the incooperation of Ai assistance in software engineering, it makes the process easier and quicker because there is always an assitant and you dont have to do it alone.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
How to make a ball vs How t make a football- while both simpley require instructions on how to make a ball the second prompt is specific to what kind of ball this means factors like material and fumctionality like use of legs for this particular ball will be put into consideration when describing the process.
